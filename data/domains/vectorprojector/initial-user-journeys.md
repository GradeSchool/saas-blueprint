# Initial User Journeys

First visit through first meaningful action. Brainstorming phase.

---

## Joe (Cold Visitor, Crowdfunding Active)

Stumbles across site. No Makerworld context.

**Sees:** Crowdfunding indicator (not blocking). "Early access ends in X days."

**Can do:** Explore UI, play with demo content, watch FAQ/videos.

**Can't do:** Import, save, export.

**Decides to:**
- Back project → returns with access
- Wait → comes back after launch
- Leave → gone forever (that's fine)

---

## Sarah (Backer, Crowdfunding Active)

Backed on Makerworld. Wants early access.

**Flow:** Visits → clicks "I'm a backer" → verifies (username + code?) → unlocked.

**Can do:** Everything. Import, save, export.

**Open:** Is access permanent? How many exports?

---

## Mike (Post-Crowdfunding Visitor)

Finds app after crowdfunding ends. Normal user.

**Sees:** No crowdfunding messaging. Standard freemium model.

**Flow:** Explore → sign up → pay for premium features.

**Open:** What's free vs paid?

---

## Alex (Former Backer, Post-Crowdfunding)

Backed during crowdfunding. Returns later.

**Expects:** Backer status still works. Projects still exist.

**Open:** Permanent access? Or must eventually subscribe?

## Key Decisions

| Question | Options |
|----------|--------|
| Crowdfunding indicator | Modal? Banner? Both? |
| Backer verification | Username + code? Honor system? |
| Backer access duration | Permanent? Time-limited? |
| Post-CF freemium model | What's free vs paid? |
