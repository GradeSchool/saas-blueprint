# Platform Overview

A platform of SaaS apps for makers—primarily the 3D printing community, but extending into adjacent creative tools.

## What We Build

**Mostly parameter-driven 3D design tools.** Users make a few choices, adjust some sliders, and get a ready-to-print model. Examples:
- Storage case systems with customizable compartments
- One-of-a-kind toys with personalized features
- SVG-to-3D extrusions for signs, stamps, and decorative pieces

**Some apps are 2D-only.** Not everything needs a third dimension:
- Tiling vector pattern generators (output: SVGs)
- Other creative tools that serve the same maker audience

**Target audience:** Makers who want custom output without mastering complex software. For 3D apps, that means bridging the gap between "download someone else's design" and "learn Fusion 360." For 2D tools, it's the same idea—powerful results without the Adobe learning curve, or, providing easy to use workflows that are too difficult in traditional programs.

## Why a Platform?

**Solo dev / family business.** Limited resources means we need force multipliers.

**Shared infrastructure.** Auth, payments, storage, UI patterns—build once, use everywhere. A new app can go from idea to MVP in days, not months.

**Cross-promotion.** Each app's user base discovers the others through Makerworld presence and in-app links. The platform grows as a network.

**Breadth over depth.** We'd rather have 5 apps with 1,000 users each than 1 app with 5,000 users. More apps means more entry points, more resilience, and more experiments. Plus, heavy, large user bases for each app means more user relations duties, more system strain, higher bandwidth costs.

## Launch Strategy

1. **Build fully.** No public "coming soon" pages. Develop the complete experience internally.
2. **Beta test.** Polish until it's genuinely ready. As close as possible. The crowdfunding period acts as "post-beta" beta testing.
3. **Makerworld Crowdfunding.** Launch through Makerworld's platform, not traditional social media. Our users are already there, looking for exactly what we build.

This approach gets us in front of the right audience immediately—people who own 3D printers and actively seek new things to print.

## Design Philosophy

**Limit features intentionally.** Each app should be fun and easy to use, not a Swiss Army knife. Complexity breeds support burden, user confusion, and slow development.

**Streamline operations.** Every feature we add is a feature we maintain, document, and support. We optimize for sustainable solo operation: minimal tech support load, efficient user communication, simple billing.

**Ship focused tools.** If an app tries to do too much, split it. Better to have two apps that each do one thing well than one app that does two things poorly.
